## Feature Implementations and Discussions

### 1. Strikethrough for Completed Tasks
**User**: "I like the strikeout you applied to differentiate the completed tasks from the active ones. :-thumbsup"

**Copilot**: Acknowledged the positive feedback about the strikethrough effect (text-decoration: line-through) that provides clear visual distinction between completed and active tasks. This UI pattern makes it immediately obvious which tasks are done without needing to look at the checkbox state.

Implementation details can be found in the test file:
```jsx
// Toggle completion
fireEvent.click(checkbox);
expect(checkbox).toBeChecked();

// Verify text decoration
const todoText = screen.getByText('Test Todo');
expect(todoText).toHaveStyle({ textDecoration: 'line-through' });
```

### 2. Add as Completed Feature
**User**: "Please provide the user with an option to set the task as completed as and when he adds it in one go."

**Copilot**: Implemented the following changes:
1. Added new `addAsCompleted` state to track whether new todos should be marked as completed
2. Added a checkbox in the form next to the add button
3. Modified the `addTodo` function to consider the `addAsCompleted` state
4. Added appropriate styling for the new checkbox
5. Added comprehensive tests

Features:
- Checkbox appears next to the input field with label "Add as completed"
- When checked, new todos are automatically marked as completed
- Todos appear directly in the "Completed Tasks" section
- Checkbox status persists until unchecked

### 3. Auto-clear Add as Completed Checkbox
**User**: "Please untick or clear the checkbox, once an todolist item is added as completed."

**Copilot**: Implemented automatic clearing of the "Add as completed" checkbox:
1. Modified `addTodo` function to reset `addAsCompleted` state after adding a todo
2. Updated tests to verify the checkbox is automatically cleared
3. Committed changes with detailed documentation

Changes ensure:
- After adding a todo as completed, the checkbox automatically clears
- Prevents accidental creation of completed todos
- Requires explicit choice for each todo to be added as completed
- Better user experience with clear intention for each todo item

### Chat Preservation Methods
**User**: "How to preserve this chat window?"

**Copilot**: Provided multiple methods for preserving chat:
1. Pin the Chat View
   - Use pin icon in top-right corner
   - Prevents clearing of conversation

2. Export the Conversation
   - Use "..." menu
   - Save as Markdown file

3. Keep Window Open
   - Chat persists across sessions until explicitly closed

4. Create New Chat
   - Use Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
   - Type "GitHub Copilot: New Chat"
   - Preserves current chat while starting new one

### Final Implementation
The chat has been documented and saved in the project repository for future reference. All features have been implemented, tested, and properly documented with comprehensive test coverage.
